Dataset : MIT-BIH Database from Kaggle
(in the dataset)
Shape : 1200 rows 56 columns
Target : ECG Signal with 4 class (Arrhythmia,ATrial Fibrillation,Congestive Heart Failure,Normal Sinus Rhythm)

(developed sample model)
_The developed model is a RandomForest which is trained and evaluated based on the pre-processed dataset that is available and the results are saved.
_The results are saved as a file with 
trained RandomForest model (.joblib)
features used to train the model (.json)
label encoder file that has maping of class names to numbers (.joblib)
confusion matrix image shows the classification performance (.png)
filtered data scaler that is used for preprocessing features (.joblib).
_Based on the give dataset Heart Rate(bpm) can be predicted which is used for classifying the data into categories 
Arrhythmia(irregular HR)
Bradycardia(HR<60bpm)
Tachycardia(HR>100bpm)
Normal (60<=HR<=100)

Fianl results
Overall Accuracy : 0.995833333333333
Final classes : Arrhythmia, Tachycardia
NOTE: Only two final classes exist because none of the instances of the dataset is meeting the criteria for Normal and Bradycardia classes
